# Adblocking info -->
# For yt ads: place the greasemonkey script yt-ads.js in your greasemonkey folder (~/.config/qutebrowser/greasemonkey).

# Yeah it's not ublock origin, but if you want a minimal browser, this is a solution for the tradeoff.
# You can also watch yt vids directly in mpv, see qutebrowser FAQ for how to do that.
# If you want additional blocklists, you can get the python-adblock package, or you can uncomment the ublock lists here.
